Can a simple food-reaching behavior emerge from an unstructured LIF cells reservoir endowed with sensory and motor neurons?Â 


        - Sight neurons -->  main pool (<- recurrent) --> premotor neurons -> motor neuron (4 actions)


Evolution through natural selection:

creation of an initial population with random connectivity weights
- selection of the fittest individual (has eaten more)
- definition of its DNA as the connectivity matrix of its brain networks (and weights values)
- creation of a new population with individual endowed with:

        - same DNA as the fittest
        
        - mutate DNA
        
        - brand new DNA
        
- repeat
